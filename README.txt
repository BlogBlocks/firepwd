Jupyter Notebook using the original firepwd.py from https://github.com/lclevy/firepwd

The changes allow using mysqlite to see the passwords . 
firepwd2text.py has a slight addition at the end to create a text file "keys3.txt" with the results.
Then by using cleantext.py the text is cleaned enough to place in the database.
cleantext.py worked with my results it may need to be further cleaned if your results differ too much
